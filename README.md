# Markdown Editor

`yarn add david-markdown-editor`

## Info

This is an extended project on top of [https://github.com/nijat13/rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/nijat13/rich-markdown-editor) which is extended on top of [https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) and is in my opinion the perfect markdown editor for projects.

## What I changed

Most functionalities are the same, I just modified some margins and type errors so that it works well with my different projects.

## Usage
